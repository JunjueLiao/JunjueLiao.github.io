## About Me

Hi there! My name is Junjue Liao and I'm a undergraduate student at <b>Shanghai Jiao Tong University</b>, enrolled in <b>Physics Zhiyuan Honor Program Class</b>. Currently, I am fortunate to work with Prof. <a href="https://www.aep.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/gennady-shvets">Gennady Shvets</a> at <a href="https://shvets.aep.cornell.edu/">Shvets Group</a> Cornell  as a research intern.

Prviously, I had a wonderful time study laser-plasma theory as an undergraduate researcher advised by Prof. <a href="https://www.physics.sjtu.edu.cn/en/jsml/zhangjie.html">Jie Zhang</a> and Prof. <a href="https://www.physics.sjtu.edu.cn/en/jsml/chenmin.html">Min Chen</a> at <a href="https://llp.sjtu.edu.cn/En">SJTU-LLP</a>. I also had a fun time to build a automatic frequency measurement system for accelerator cavity at <a href="http://e-ssrf.sari.ac.cn/">SSRF</a> as a summer intern.

I'm also looking for a physics Ph.D. position in 2025 Fall. Feel free to check out my CV and send me an <a href="mailto:junjueliao03@gmail.com">e-mail</a> if you want to contact me.
